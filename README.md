# AppDev1_Project
My first Website (project) which was part of my IITM BS AppDev-1 course.

Here, I present you a very basic Flask Website namely GroceryStore with zero API(which i've no clue about as of now)

Language used:
Python - (Framework used: Flask,
          including libraries such as:
          SqlAlchemy (for database management)
          matplotlib (for graph presentation) )
HTML - (used Jinja templating)
Bootstrap- (for navigation-bar {navbar} and buttons)
